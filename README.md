# voronlegacy enclosed

this is a mashup of the 1.8, trident and legacy.

1.8 z axis, trident enclosure and at the heart of the printer lives a legacy x axis.

the model is mostly complete, minus the foam tape, which you can reference from the other cad files in the vorondesign repository. 

there were some mods to accomodate the cable chain, mainly moving the mounting points but other than that, if you study the cad closely, it should be pretty easily reproduced.
